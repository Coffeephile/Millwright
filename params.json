{"name":"Millwright","tagline":"A simple ticket tracking system built to get things done.","body":"## Welcome to Millwright.\r\nThere are almost as many ticket tracking systems floating around the Internet as there are pictures of cats. I didn't find one that _really_ met the criteria that I was looking for, though. I wanted something that was simple and lightweight, but that didn't cost a million bucks or require tons of weird setup. Since the tracking systems I could find weren't meeting my criteria, I decided to make my own.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Technology\r\nMillwright is built using [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), and the templating engine [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/).\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nMillwright's main page is where the majority of work will be done.\r\n![Main page as of 1/10/2014](http://i.imgur.com/DXy9A3c.png)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nTo install the latest build of Millwright, ensure that you have git, node, and npm installed. You'll also need to have a mongodb instance running locally. Then just clone the repo and run app.js.\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/Linell/Millwright`\r\n\r\n`cd Millwright && npm install`\r\n\r\n`node app.js`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
